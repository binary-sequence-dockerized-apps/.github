# Contributing

This file explains the expected form in which contributors should offer their ideas and suggestions. Any violation of the following guidelines may result in the rejection of the contribution, including but not limited to github issues and pull requests.

## Guidelines

1. Any contributor must **follow the *CODE_OF_CONDUCT***
2. To avoid frustation after investing time in code changes, **before any change is made, a github issue must be created** and properly discussed. Not all ideas are good for everyone, and project maintainers may find an idea not suitable for the project, not scalable or not worth for the maintenance cost.
3. Any github issue which **does not follow *ISSUE_TEMPLATE* guidelines**, will be rejected.
4. Any pull request which **does not follow *PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE* guidelines**, will be rejected.

Project maintainers reserve the right of adding more guidelines and rejecting contributions even if all guidelines are followed.
