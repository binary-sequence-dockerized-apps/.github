# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This project doesn't have any supported version, but this should not avoid people from using it.
For that reason it is necessary to protect them from possible security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Exposing a vulnerability in the open before it is fixed is dangerous because it makes more exploiters to know the vulnerability.

If you find a security vulnerability, please send an email to sergiolindo.empresa@gmail.com explaining the vulnerability and how to reproduce it.
Fixes are also welcome in the form of git patches.
